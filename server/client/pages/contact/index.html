      <h2>Reasons why you should be my friend:</h2>
      <p>
        There are many obvious reasons why you should be my friend (ridiculously good-looking, IQ of 1000+)
        but there are also ones that aren't so easy to discern.  They include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I am a good conversationalist and, unless I'm super busy, I can hold a conversation pretty well with anyone.</li>
        <li>I will send u the most outrageous gifs you've ever seen.</li>
        <li>I can sing the fast part in Sweet Escape</li>
        <li>Exclusive insider access to pics of Caravaggio</li>
        <li>I want to know about you!!!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Reasons why you should NOT be my friend:</h2>
      <p>
        Though I am such a WONDERFUL and LOVELY person that just gets along with absolutely
        ~everybody~ she ever meets, there are maybe a couple of things that would make us
        not get along.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We have differing political takes and you're unwilling to engage in discussion.  (More of a problem if ur conservative) </li>
        <li>You're a columbiner (yuck... grow up)</li>
        <li>You knew me in high school (sorry you had to see that)</li>
        <li>You like dogs more than cats (though I am open to discussion !!!)</li>
      </ul>
